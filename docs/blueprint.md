## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#77B5FE) to convey trust and reliability.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F8), a very desaturated tone of the primary color, creating a clean and professional look.
- Accent color: Pale purple (#B19CD9), analogous to blue, to highlight interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for a modern and neutral feel.
- Use simple, outlined icons to represent painting areas and options.
- Use a clean, grid-based layout for form elements and results display.
- Use subtle transitions and animations for form element display and estimate loading.
